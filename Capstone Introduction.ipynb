            "source": "New York City, a.k.a. the Big Apple, is situated in northeastern U.S. and is the financial capital of the country. It hosts many neighborhoods within its five boroughs - Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island - and each of these boroughs exhibits its own lifestyle. New York City is heavily populated and ethinically diverse. In 2017, the city had an estimated population density of 28,491 inhabitants per square mile (11,000/km2) [1]. It is one of the most international cities in the country. \n\nNew York City boosts tremendous business opportunities, and is a global hub of business and commerce. Much of New York's business success is due to the real estate market [2], although the city is also a major center for many other types of business. The highly competitve busienss market in New York City has driven up its cost of living. Thus, new comers who wish to move into the city need to carefully analyze the costs and benefits asscociated with living in New York before making a serious financial commitment. Particularly, people who are interested in moving to New York City should understand the culturally diversed neighborhoods and their identifying characteristics, as well as the housing prices in each neighborhood. In addition, what features of a neighborhood are mostly likely to affect the housing price? Answers to these questions will help new comers make a more informed decision about where they should choose to live, given the tradeoffs between the lifestyle they are seeking for and the prices they have to pay for expensive living in the city.
